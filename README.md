# Quantitative_Question_Answering

Quantitative Question Answering (QQA) is answer-
ing numerical reasoning questions where the model
picks the right option based on provided facts. Tra-
ditional NLP models are not good at implicit nu-
merical reasoning, so there is a need to investigate
methods that improve numeracy comprehension.
In our project, we will assess the performance
of various transformer-based models to perform
the QQA task using multiple input reframing meth-
ods. We will investigate how model performance
varies with various numerical representations and
investigate various solutions to improve quantita-
tive reasoning ability.
